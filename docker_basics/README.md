What is Docker?
Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
In simple terms, Docker is an open source platform for building, deploying, and managing containerized applications.

What is the difference between Virtual machines and Docker?
VM's have got one host OS/Hypervisor on a physical server and have got guest OS inside each VM. A guest OS can be any OS, like Linux or Windows irrespective of host OS.
In contrast, Docker containers hosts on a single physical server with a host OS, which shares among them. Sharing the host OS between Containers makes them light and increases the boot time.

What is a Container?
A Container is a unit of software that packages code and its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably across computing environments.

What is Container vs Image?
Image is a teamplate containing the required software.
Container is the realworld running entity.
